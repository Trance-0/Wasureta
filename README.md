# Wasureta
A AI driven tool to help people learn foreign language, our goal is to do better than stupid Duolingo.

This is a fast prototype development to build my knowledge in Flutter frontend with Django-rest backend.

Original from Notechondria. Wasureta in Japanese, means I forgot.

This is a fontend app help people to build relationship between their home language and foreign language. With advancement of AI, it's still interesting to learn a new language. Isn't it? I guess?
